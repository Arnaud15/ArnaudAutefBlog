Hello! My name is Arnaud Autef.

On this personal website, I post about Machine Learning, Statistics and Optimization. Some more specific topics that I follow more closely are Reinforcement and Bandit Learning, Natural Language Processing, the big "representation learning" bucket in Deep Learning (e.g: constrastive learning), and Bayesian Deep Learning.

I use the fastpages website template to make it easy for readers to leave comments, and I am very much looking forward to feedback there!


Some words about my background:


I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Sisu Data. In Sisu's ML team, I work on machine learning systems that must scale to billion row datasets with hundreds of thousands of predictive features, producing results in less than minutes. So far, the algorithms I have developed use tools from high-dimensional statistics, optimization and information theory. As our roadmap moves rapidly, I expect future projects to involve techniques from the recommendations sytems community and some Deep Learning.

What I enjoy most in my work at Sisu, is that I own my Machine Learning projects end-to-end: from literature review, to prototyping in Python and productionization in Rust (with some extra database and frontend work sometimes, to expose my algorithms all the way to Sisu customers).


Finally, I am leading Sisu's Machine Learning reading group, and I encourage you to check out paper reviews from our amazing team members [there](https://sisudata.com/blog/learning-unsupervised). Some of my public posts covered: the LassoNet, Simple Bayesian Algorithms for Best Arm identification, the R-learner, and the Synthetic Controls Method.


Prior to joining Sisu, I was a MSc student in Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University, focusing my coursework on Statistics, Optimization and Deep Learning.


During my time at Stanford, I spent 6 months building a recommendation system in Jure Leskovec's SNAP research group, as a Research Assistant. I was a teaching assistant for two classes: CS224N with Prof. Christopher Manning (Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning) and CS236 (Deep Generative Models) with Prof. Stefano Ermon. 


I also interned at Microsoft in Redmond, and used statistics and bandit learning for hardware failures mitigation in Azure Compute.


Finally, I spent 6 months doing research on the Assortment Optimization problem, supervised by Prof. Benjamin Van Roy and Xiuyuan Lu.


Before Stanford, I interned for 5 months at IBM Research Singapore with Dr. Shiau Hong Lim. We published our research in Reinforcement Learning theory at ICML 2019, where I presented our paper "Kernel based reinforcement learning in Robust Markov Decision Processes".


Prior to that, I earned a MSc in Applied Mathematics from the Ecole Polytechnique (Paris), where my coursework focused on Probability, Statistics, Optimization and Machine Learning.
