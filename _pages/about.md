Hello! My name is Arnaud Autef and welcome to my personal website.

I post about Machine Learning, Statistics and Optimization. Some topics that I follow more closely are Reinforcement and Bandit Learning, Natural Language Processing, the big "representation learning" bucket in Deep Learning (e.g: constrastive learning), and Bayesian Deep Learning.

I use the fastpages website template to make it easy for readers to leave comments, and I am very much looking forward to feedback there! If comments are not for you, feel free to send me an email (firstname.lastname at gmail).


### Some words about my background


I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Sisu Data](https://sisudata.com/). In Sisu's ML team, I work on machine learning systems that must scale to billion row datasets with hundreds of thousands of predictive features, producing results in less than minutes. So far, the algorithms I have developed use tools from high-dimensional statistics, optimization and information theory. As our roadmap moves rapidly, I expect future projects to involve techniques from the recommendations sytems community and some Deep Learning.

In my work at Sisu, I own Machine Learning projects end-to-end: from literature review, to prototyping in Python, and productionization in Rust (with some extra database and frontend work sometimes, to expose my algorithms to Sisu customers faster if other engineering teams are stretched). I am also very lucky to have had Vladimir Feinberg as my mentor there, do check out his [amazing blog](https://vladfeinberg.com/).


In parallel to IC work, I am in charge of the Statistics phone screen (which I designed) and the Probability interview for Machine Learning Engineer candidates. I am mentoring our latest team member, and leading Sisu's Machine Learning reading group. I encourage you to check out paper reviews from our talented team members [there](https://sisudata.com/blog/learning-unsupervised).


Prior to joining Sisu, I was a MSc student in Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University, focusing my coursework on Statistics, Optimization and Deep Learning.


During my time at Stanford, I spent 6 months building a recommendation system in Jure Leskovec's [SNAP research group](http://snap.stanford.edu/), as a Research Assistant. I was a teaching assistant for two classes: [CS224N](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) with Prof. Christopher Manning (Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning) and [CS236](https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/) (Deep Generative Models) with Prof. Stefano Ermon. 


I was also very fortunate to spend 6 months doing research on Information Direction Sampling (IDS) for the Assortment Optimization problem, supervised by Dr. Xiuyuan Lu and Professor Benjamin Van Roy. I first experimented with ideas around a "greedy" version of IDS, presented my findings in a [reading group talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-JmTivVVgy-DbNXRVznDvFI_uoTUQ5aj/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106255424794425072671&rtpof=true&sd=true) and wrote them up a [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vBHfSFscriZ8RrlVahtOn0VtIOi8PahT/view?usp=sharing). I came back to the topic in 2020 while working at Sisu, inspired by a lecture from Tore Lattimore on IDS: I obtained two theoretical results on the simple form of IDS solutions with independent item-level information gains, and information theoretic regret bounds for Thompson Sampling on the assortment optimization problem. See [there](https://wise-turret-40a.notion.site/PRESENTATION-Information-Directed-Sampling-on-Combinatorial-Action-Sets-96ed3bf35c4e42e1b3b59e2bb41ec29f) for an overview of those latest findings, and happy to answer questions about proofs details.


Finally, during my summer 2019 at Stanford, I interned at Microsoft in Redmond and used statistics and bandit learning to improve hardware failures mitigation in Azure Compute.


Before Stanford, I interned for 5 months at IBM Research Singapore with Dr. Shiau Hong Lim. We published our research in Reinforcement Learning theory at ICML 2019, where I presented our paper ["Kernel based reinforcement learning in Robust Markov Decision Processes"](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/lim19a.html).


Prior to that, I earned a MSc in Applied Mathematics from the Ecole Polytechnique (Paris), where my coursework focused on Probability, Statistics, Optimization and Machine Learning.
