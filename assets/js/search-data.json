            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .

          "title": "About Me",
          "content": ". Hello! My name is Arnaud Autef. . On this personal website, I post about Machine Learning, Statistics and Optimization. Some more specific topics that I follow more closely are Reinforcement and Bandit Learning, Natural Language Processing, the big “representation learning” bucket in Deep Learning (e.g: constrastive learning), and Bayesian Deep Learning. . I use the fastpages website template to make it easy for readers to leave comments, and I am very much looking forward to feedback there! If comments are not for you, feel free to send me an email (firstname.lastname at gmail). . Some words about my background . I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Sisu Data. In Sisu’s ML team, I work on machine learning systems that must scale to billion row datasets with hundreds of thousands of predictive features, producing results in less than minutes. So far, the algorithms I have developed use tools from high-dimensional statistics, optimization and information theory. As our roadmap moves rapidly, I expect future projects to involve techniques from the recommendations sytems community and some Deep Learning. . What I enjoy most in my work at Sisu, is that I own my Machine Learning projects end-to-end: from literature review, to prototyping in Python and productionization in Rust (with some extra database and frontend work sometimes, to expose my algorithms all the way to Sisu customers). I have also been very lucky to have Vladimir Feinberg as my mentor there, do check out his amazing blog. . Finally, I am currently leading Sisu’s Machine Learning reading group, and I encourage you to check out paper reviews from our amazing team members there. . Prior to joining Sisu, I was a MSc student in Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University, focusing my coursework on Statistics, Optimization and Deep Learning. . During my time at Stanford, I spent 6 months building a recommendation system in Jure Leskovec’s SNAP research group, as a Research Assistant. I was a teaching assistant for two classes: CS224N with Prof. Christopher Manning (Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning) and CS236 (Deep Generative Models) with Prof. Stefano Ermon. . I also interned at Microsoft in Redmond, and used statistics and bandit learning for hardware failures mitigation in Azure Compute. . Finally, I spent 6 months doing research on the Assortment Optimization problem, supervised by Prof. Benjamin Van Roy and Xiuyuan Lu. . Before Stanford, I interned for 5 months at IBM Research Singapore with Dr. Shiau Hong Lim. We published our research in Reinforcement Learning theory at ICML 2019, where I presented our paper “Kernel based reinforcement learning in Robust Markov Decision Processes”. . Prior to that, I earned a MSc in Applied Mathematics from the Ecole Polytechnique (Paris), where my coursework focused on Probability, Statistics, Optimization and Machine Learning. . Find me on .
